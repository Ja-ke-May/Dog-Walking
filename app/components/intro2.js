          My focus is your best friend. I believe your dog deserves to be completely fulfilled from our walks both mentally and physically, so they will have my full attention and care. 
<span className="brightness-125">BIG WALKS</span> aren't just long walks, they are full of enrichment, adventure and enjoyment. 
<br />
I do not offer groups walks, it will only ever be me and Jack with your dog or dogs to ensure they have the best time possible. I will come for a short visit initially, 10 minutes or so, to confirm we are good to go.
